Voter
===========

This is a WIP, but will be a simple application that allows
arbitrary information to be entered and voted upon.

Some stretch goals for it will be authentication for users
and arbitrary creation of vote sessions.

Initially I'm thinking that each unique client will get 10 votes
for whatever they want.  Entering an item on the list requires the
user of one inital vote.  Votes can be removed an reassigned.  Removing
the last vote of an item will cause the item to disappear from the
list.
